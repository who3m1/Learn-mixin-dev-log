Sure! Here are the general steps to set up Nginx as a reverse proxy server to serve your graph node service over HTTPS:

1. Install Nginx: You can install Nginx on your server by running the following command:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

2. Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate: You can obtain a free SSL/TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt using Certbot. Run the following commands to install Certbot and obtain a certificate:

```
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

Make sure to replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name. Follow the prompts to obtain and install the certificate.

3. Configure Nginx: Once you have obtained the SSL/TLS certificate, you need to configure Nginx to use it. Open the Nginx configuration file for your site using a text editor:

```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com
```

Add the following configuration to the file:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name and update the `proxy_pass` setting with the correct port number for your graph node service.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Test the configuration: Run the following command to test the Nginx configuration:

```
sudo nginx -t
```

If there are no errors, reload Nginx to apply the new configuration:

```
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

5. Verify HTTPS access: Visit `https://yourdomain.com` in a web browser to verify that the graph node service is accessible over HTTPS.

That's it! You should now have a working Nginx server that serves your graph node service over HTTPS.
